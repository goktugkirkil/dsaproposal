DSA210 project proposal

Motivation: Why are you working on this project?

  I think that medical technology is a work space that we should develop as a country. Right now I am trying to code an AI Agent that analyzes this data and give doctors some hypothesis     with causation and correlation using SPSS methods, so finishing this project is a motivation for me as well.
  
Data Source: Where did you get this data? How did you collect it?

  I have found a dataset that consists of 2532 obese people who got into bariatric surgery. This dataset consists of their age, gender, operation type, whether there are extra operations    or not, and their values of insulin and pepdide. The dataset also keeps track of their height ยง weight after the operation in a time frame. This data was collected by my father who is     a surgeon.
  
Data Analysis: Techniques used, different stages of analysis

  I use ML & SPSS methods. Firstly I use destrciptive analysis -for extraction and summary of the dataset- then I use correlation analysis (Pearson, chi-square, etc.) -to decide to which    hypothesis to write on / whether there is correlation or not- then data visualization which is a form of ML and lastly I use SPSS to identify the dataset and prove mty hypothesis to be    true or false.
  
Findings: What are the interesting findings that you found in this project?

  Looking other people's lives as number is a thing that I find interesting in the first place - however, it is too general - if you want me to be spesific through this project some         people's before and after was quite interesting, like how could an enormous change like that could happen in just 3-4 months.
  
Limitations and Future Work: What could be done better? Do you have any future plans on your project?

  As I said I want to continue to this project as making it an AI Agent and working on how to sell that. However, I want to achieve that with the informations I've learned thorough this     lesson. I think that if I've added some diet plans and image estimators (ex. you will look like this in 3 months (with ML) ), and make it publicly available I could've made a system for   the good of both patients and doctors.
